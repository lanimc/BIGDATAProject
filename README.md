Final Project on taxi and citibike data - Understanding the Complex Interactions in New York City


Understanding the Complex Interactions in New York City
-------------------------------------------------------

Cities are the loci of resource consumption, of economic activity, and of innovation; they are the cause of our looming sustainability problems but also where those problems must be solved. Our increasing ability to collect, transmit, and store data, coupled with the growing trend towards openness, creates a unique opportunity that can benefit government, science, citizens and industry.

Urban data is unique in that it captures the behavior of the different components of a city, namely its citizens, existing infrastructure (physical and policies), the environment (e.g.: weather), and interactions between these elements. The availability of these data makes it possible to not only better understand the individual components but also obtain insights into how they interact.

In this project, you will work with spatio-temporal urban data and try to find and explain some interactions between these elements of the city. You will use event detection and correlation techniques to analyze different types of urban data and uncover interesting relationships among them. Please follow the instructions below.
